# ELEC 291 Project 1
## Oven reflow controller

###### Guidlines:
-Design,  build,  program,  and  test  a  Reflow  Oven  Controller  using  any  microcontroller/processor. 
-Your  reflow  oven  controller  should  be  capable  of  measuring 
temperatures between 25C and 240C.  
-Operate a 1500W toaster oven using a solid state relay.
-This year the oven controller has to “talk” as part of the user interface.  This task is 
accomplished  by  using  Pulse  Coded  Modulation  (PCM)  together  with  a  Digital  to 
Analog  Converter  (DAC).Since  storing  PCM  sound  requires  significantly  large 
amounts of non-volatile memory, the 25Q32 4 Mbyte SPI flash memory is included 
in the project 1  kit.   
-Have selectable reflow profile parameters through pushbuttons, display temperature and running time on an LCD, and have audio feedback through PCM and DAC.
-Have start/stop pushbutton and ability to stop the process at any moment.
-Have a temperature strip chart plot through the serial port of a personal computer.
-Require assembly of at least three EFM8 PCBs using components from the project kit.
-Have automatic cycle termination on error.
